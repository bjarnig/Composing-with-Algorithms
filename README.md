# Composing with Algorithms

An introduction to algorithmic composition, its applications, history and
implementations. Participants will learn to program sound, control and
musical behaviour.

Topics such as using probabilities, generative algorithms, complex systems
and selection principles will be presented. Each of these will cover
technique but also practical applications and musical examples.

The course will be using the SuperCollider environment as well as
providing short introductions to other platforms.
