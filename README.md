# Composing with Algorithms

This course explores algorithmic composition techniques and their historical context,
focusing on the development of computer-assisted composition from the 1950s to the
present day. Students learn to create musical works using algorithmic processes
and programming techniques in SuperCollider.

The course covers historical approaches to algorithmic composition, probability
theory, set theory, and various compositional strategies used by pioneering
composers such as Xenakis, Koenig, and others.
